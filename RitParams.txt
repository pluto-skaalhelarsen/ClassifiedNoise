Table I describes the SP parameters as named in the paper, and the numbered entries below them are footnotes 17, 18, and 19 from page 9 of the paper, describing the parameters used for processing images from the famous NIST handwritten digit database. The RIT researchers have their own implementation of of the HTM SP with a hardware realization as its goal, and their parameterization follows closely that of the Numenta NuPIC code except for the RIT parameter q, the number of proximal synapses per column.

NuPIC defines the potentialRadius param from which can be derived the number of inputs available to the proximal dendrite of a column, and the potentialPct param giving the fraction of the potential inputs that are actually connected. From these values the eqivalent of RIT's q parameter can be derived from the formula:

From the NuPIC code comments:
At initialization time we choose 
	((2*potentialRadius + 1)^(# inputDimensions) * potentialPct)
input bits to comprise the column's potential pool.

The example code uses a one-dimensional input. The potentialPct default of 0.5 is mentioned several times in the Numenta documentation. 

potentialRadius = q/(2*potentialPct) - 0.5

Numerically:

potentialRadius = 353/1 - 0.5 = 352.5

So, q is essentially the potentialRadius out of the 784 input bits of the MNIST data.

For a 2-dimensional input:

q = (2*potentialRadius + 1)^2 * potentialPct
